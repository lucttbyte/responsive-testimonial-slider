# Responsive Testimonial Slider (Swiper.js)

This project is a clean, responsive testimonial card slider built using the [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) library. It's a single-page implementation demonstrating a common UI pattern for displaying reviews, testimonials, or team members.

The slider is built with plain HTML, CSS, and a small JavaScript snippet to initialize the Swiper instance.

## Features

* **Responsive:** Adjusts the number of slides visible based on screen width (1 on small screens, 2 on medium, and 3 on larger screens).
* **Looping:** The slider loops back to the beginning infinitely.
* **Centered Slides:** The currently active slide is always centered in the viewport.
* **Navigation:** Includes "Next" and "Previous" navigation buttons.
* **Custom Styling:** Features custom-styled testimonial cards with gradient backgrounds, rounded images, and shadows.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* **Swiper.js (v7)**
